A church choir song directory and song selector. 

Many church choirs keep physical files of their songs. Searching out songs from the growing heap is a tedious exercise.
Secondly, many choirs use some songs rather too frequently, while totally forgetting some other equally good compositions.

This webapp seeks to address both problems by:
  1. Maintaining a directory of learnt songs.
  2. Having a dated song selection entity. Which is actually a collection of songs used for a particular event.
  3. keep track of number of selections for any particular song.
